# PedestriansDynamics
An evacuation of pedestrians in a room

## How to make your own simulation

- Create your room configuration on an image file (black pixel = wall, white pixel = empty cell, any other color = exit) or use one already created in the directory "resources".
- Modify the config.py file with the desired configuration.
- Run main.py.

## Requirements

Python version 3.6+, won't work with Python 2.
Run in your terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
